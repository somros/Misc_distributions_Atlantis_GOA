# Misc_distributions_Atlantis_GOA
This repo contains code that produces the S1-S4 spatial distribution parameters for model groups where the RACE-DFO stitching was not possible, for example because of models not converging or with not enough data points. The herring and salmon code is based on GOAIERP data and previous workflows, the 'miscellaneous' code contains mainly thos species that were modelled in sdmTMB with the RACE-GAP data but could not be stitched between AK and BC because of limited data coverage or models not converging in BC. All scripts fill the empty boxes and extend the distributions to BC, often based on a simple guess based on depth.
